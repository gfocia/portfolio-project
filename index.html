                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p> In Fall 2021, I took a Python programming course that delved into the basics
                        of the Python language, object oriented programming, recursion, writing artificial
                        intelligence code, and algorithm time analysis. I had a wonderful professor who made
                        this class so enjoyable. I actually just wrote him a letter of reccomendation because
                        he was asked to apply to be a professor on the tenure track at UC Berkeley, which is amazing!
                        For our final project, we used object oriented programming to create a connect four game which 
                        had an AI player, it was so interesting! I still use Python very often for all of my math classes. 
                        In Fall 2022, I used Python a lot in my Linear Algebra course because we learned about Computer 
                        Graphics and how essentially all of it is just matrix manipulation that coordinates to objects being
                        able to rotate and project onto a screen. I wrote code that made a ball rotate, which seems very simple, 
                        but it gave me a lot more experience in using all of the amazing math packages that Python has to offer.

                    <h3>Java</h3>
                    <p> Java is my personal favorite, although that is biased because I am a TA for a Java course at my school. 
                        I was first introduced to the Java programming languauge in Spring 2022. I took a Java course that went 
                        over the basis of Java, object oriented programming, recursive backtracking, sorting algorithms,
                        algorithm time analysis, data structures, and computer memory. I fell in love with how interesting this 
                        course was. I excelled in the course, and the Professor then asked me to TA for it the following semester. 
                        I use Java essentially on a daily basis, and I am really thankful to be a TA for this course because it 
                        keeps me fresh on my toes on almost every topic that is brought up in coding interviews about algorithm 
                        efficency and the best way to implement code. I love teaching my students because while this course is 
                        very difficult, it teaches most of the fundamental computer science concepts that are so important to know
                        as a software developer. It makes me so happy that I am able to introduce these kids to my personal favorite
                        programming language and help them understand these fuundamental concepts that will help them immensley with 
                        their careers forever.

                    <h3>Assembly + C</h3>
                    <p> In Fall 2022, I was first introduced to Assembly Language. I took a course where we learned about
                        what a computer actually is, and all of the back-end componets that allow writing code in an IDE
                        to look so simple. To do this, we were asked to code in terminal the whole semester (aka-- no debugging).
                        It was very challenging at first, but I am so thankful that I took this course because now I know so much
                        more as a programmer. I now know the Von Neumann Architecture of a computer, how a CPU works, how all 
                        instructions are held in memory, and how at the end of the day, all of the fancy code that we write is just 
                        broken down into machine code so that the CPU can execute it. We then gradually moved to programming in C, 
                        which is also a very low-level language, but definetly a lot more advanced than Assembly Language. This 
                        course taught me so much more about the actual hardware of computers, and since we used Git and GitHub 
                        for this course to save all of our progress, it also made me extremely farmilar with Version Control.
